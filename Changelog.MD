## :jigsaw: Addon Updates (2026-01-22)

**AchTrackWW** — v1.0.6  

**Changes:**  
• Right-clicking an achievement now tracks it in the Objective Tracker.  
• Registered the main frame with WoW’s Escape handling system (ESC now closes the window cleanly and respects UI order).  
• Added a minimap button using the AchTrackWW logo:
  • Left-click toggles the tracker window  
  • Right-click hides/shows the minimap icon  
  • Position and visibility saved between sessions  
• Minimap tooltip now lists all available slash commands for quick reference.

**Fixes:**  
• Eliminated login and `/reload` UI freezes caused by heavy achievement scanning.  
• Achievement title-to-ID scanning now only runs when unresolved labels are detected.  
• Initial UI build no longer runs automatically on world entry.  
• Improved resilience against incomplete or missing achievement data.

**Known issues:**  
• None currently known.
